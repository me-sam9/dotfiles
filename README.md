# Leliel's Dotfiles
This are my personal dotfiles. Feel free to use them for whatever you want.

## What does it have?
- Configuration files for:
    - bash
    - git
    - nvim
    - xorg
    - picom
    - dunst
    - fastfetch
    - mpv
    - sxhkd
    - sxiv
    - gtk
    - yt-dlp
    - zathura
    - mimeapps
- A bunch of shell scripts
- An emoji file

## Usage
- It's recommended to use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow) to use this dotfiles, but you're free to use the method you want to use. Otherwise, download them yourself and link their paths on the Makefile.
- And, of course, you will need [git](https://git-scm.com), to clone the repository.

Then, run this.
```
git clone https://github.com/leliel-git/dotfiles.git
stow dotfiles
```
